# Pain001 Library

## Overview

The Pain001 library is a Python package that generates a Customer-to-
Bank Credit Transfer payload in the pain.001.001.03 format from a CSV
file. The package is named after the standard file format for SEPA and
non-SEPA Credit Transfer, which is the Pain (payment initiation) format
001.001.03. The Pain001 library provides a convenient way for developers
to create payment files in this format.
